# CLSI (Cross Language Scripting Interface)
### Description
This software uses alot of configuration files to generate functionally identical source code for multiple languages using using function definitions the user provides and a central code file that contains the description of the functionallity of the code to be generated.

### Notes
Currently the software is in a pre-alpha stage so bugs and lack of features are plentyful. The current interface and stgructure of the configuration files is going to resemble the final version. This is subject to change.
