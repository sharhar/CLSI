# Multi-Language-Benchmark-Generator
These python scripts will use the user provided .tl files to generate instructions on how to use the information in the .ts file to generate source code for multiple languages then compile and run them. This software will then time how long each language takes to compile and to run the program and other information in the future. I created this for use to compare different languages in speed and any other aspects.
###Note
currently the software is in a pre-alpha stage. This doesn't resemble the planned state for later version, but is instead a proof of concept.
